## Requirements

Before starting this mini workshop, the following runtime/tools must be met and configured properly.

- Active [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) `v16` or latest with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed.
- [AWS CLI version 2](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
- API Testing Tools.
  > **Note** </br>
  > This mini workshop will use [`curl`](https://curl.se/) to test the APIs. However, you can use your favorite API testing tools (e.g. Postman/Insomnia/Thunder Client/etc).
- (optional) OS based on Linux.
  > **Note** </br>
  > Build script for package lambda function code and it's dependecies require Linux/Unix shell to operate. If you are using an OS other than Linux and/or your device doesn't support Linux shell commands you can customize [this build script](/functions/build.sh) to make sure it runs properly.

      > ðŸ’¡ TIP
      >
      > `<your_cognito_userpool_id>` in Issuer URL **should be same** as `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` value on Lambda environment variables. While, Audience value **should be same** as `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` value on Lambda enviroment variables.

   2. Attach authorizer for all routes.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Step 1: Create Cognito user.

You can create via AWS CLI:

- Create user

  ```bash
  aws cognito-idp sign-up \
    --client-id <cognito_app_client_id_of_userpool> \
    --username <your_username> \
    --user-attributes Name=email,Value=<your_mail> \
    --password <your_password>
  ```

- Verify user

  ```bash
   aws cognito-idp admin-confirm-sign-up \
   --user-pool-id <your_cognito_userpool_id> \
    --username <your_username>
  ```

You can also [create user via Amazon Cognito console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/how-to-create-user-accounts.html#creating-a-new-user-using-the-users-tab). If you enable hosted UI when setup Cognito, you can [create user via hosted UI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-hosted-ui-user-sign-up.html).

### Step 2: Test API

> ðŸ§ªâš  Scenario
>
> For testing, you're going to do 3 scenarios:
>
> 1. Using random string as authorization token and without using authorization token â€” which will make the requests failed
> 2. Using JWT token from Amazon Cognito which will led to successful request
> 3. Test all API endpoint

1.  First scenario:

    - Open terminal

    - Execute following commands:

      without authorization token

      ```bash
      curl https://<your-http-api-gateway-endpoint>/book
      ```

      with random string as authorization token

      ```bash
      curl -H "Authorization: MY-RANDOM-STRING" https://<your-http-api-gateway-endpoint>/book
      ```

    - If you see the following response, then your cognito JWT authorizer works correctly

      ```json
      { "message": "Unauthorized" }
      ```

2.  Second scenario:

    - Open terminal

    - Get JWT token from Cognito using AWS CLI

      ```bash
      aws cognito-idp initiate-auth \
        --auth-flow USER_PASSWORD_AUTH \
        --client-id <cognito_app_client_id_of_userpool> \
        --auth-parameters USERNAME=<your-username>,PASSWORD='<your-password>'
      ```

      If you see the following response, copy token from `IdToken`

      ```json
      {
        "ChallengeParameters": {},
        "AuthenticationResult": {
          "AccessToken": "a1b2c3d4e5c644444555556666Y2X3Z1111",
          "ExpiresIn": 3600,
          "TokenType": "Bearer",
          "RefreshToken": "xyz654cba321dddccc1111",
          "IdToken": "a1b2c3d4e5c6aabbbcccddd"
        }
      }
      ```

3.  Test `GET /book` endpoint to **list all books**

    Execute the following command:

    ```bash
    curl -H 'Authorization: <paste-your-IdToken>' \
    https://<your-http-api-gateway-endpoint>/book
    ```

    If you see the following response, then it works correctly

    ```json
    { "data": [] }
    ```

4.  Test `POST /book` endpoint to **add new books**

    Sample data (single):

    ```json
    {
      "bookTitle": "Cosmos",
      "bookAuthor": "Carl Sagan"
    }
    ```

    Sample multiple data:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "bookTitle": "Chainsaw Man, Vol. 1",
        "bookAuthor": "Tatsuki Fujimoto"
      },
      {
        "bookTitle": "Chainsaw Man, Vol. 2",
        "bookAuthor": "Tatsuki Fujimoto"
      },
      {
        "bookTitle": "Chainsaw Man, Vol. 3",
        "bookAuthor": "Tatsuki Fujimoto"
      }
    ]
    ```

    Execute the following commands:

    Send data (single)

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
      https://<your-http-api-gateway-endpoint>/book \
      -H 'Authorization: <paste-your-IdToken>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"bookTitle": "Cosmos", "bookAuthor": "Carl Sagan"}'
    ```

    Send multiple data

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
      https://<your-http-api-gateway-endpoint>/book \
      -H 'Authorization: <paste-your-IdToken>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '[{"bookTitle":"Chainsaw Man, Vol. 1","bookAuthor":"Tatsuki Fujimoto"},{"bookTitle":"Chainsaw Man, Vol. 2","bookAuthor":"Tatsuki Fujimoto"},{"bookTitle":"Chainsaw Man, Vol. 3","bookAuthor":"Tatsuki Fujimoto"}]'
    ```

    If you see the following response, then it works correctly

    ```json
    { "message": "success" }
    ```

5.  Test `GET /book/{id}` endpoint to **get detail book**

    Get current book that available

    ```bash
    curl -H 'Authorization: <paste-your-IdToken>' \
    https://<your-http-api-gateway-endpoint>/book
    ```

    If you see the following response, copy id from `readingID`

    > **Note** </br> `readingID` may be different value than the example. **Adjust the id with your output**.

    ```json
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "readingID": "abcd1234-ab12-cd23-ef45-abcdef123456",
          "userID": "john",
          "bookTitle": "Cosmos",
          "bookAuthor": "Carl Sagan",
          ...
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

    Get detail book:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET \
      https://<your-http-api-gateway-endpoint>/book/<readingID> \
      -H 'Authorization: <paste-your-IdToken>'
    ```

    If you see the following response, then it works correctly

    ```json
    {
      "readingID": "abcd1234-ab12-cd23-ef45-abcdef123456",
      "userID": "john",
      "bookTitle": "Cosmos",
      "bookAuthor": "Carl Sagan",
      "dateAdded": 1690370601856,
      "readingStatus": "added",
      "lastUpdated": 1690370601856,
      "lastPageRead": null
      "dateFinished": null,
    }
    ```

6.  Test `DELETE /book/{id}` endpoint to **delete book**

    Get current book that available

    ```bash
    curl -H 'Authorization: <paste-your-IdToken>' \
    https://<your-http-api-gateway-endpoint>/book
    ```

    If you see the following response, copy id from `readingID`

    > **Note** </br> `readingID` may be different value than the example. **Adjust the id with your output**.

    ```json
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "readingID": "abcd1234-ab12-cd23-ef45-abcdef123456",
          "userID": "john",
          "bookTitle": "Cosmos",
          "bookAuthor": "Carl Sagan",
          ...
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

    Delete book

    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE \
      https://<your-http-api-gateway-endpoint>/book/<readingID> \
      -H 'Authorization: <paste-your-IdToken>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    ```

    If you see the following response, then it works correctly

    ```json
    { "message": "success" }
    ```
